# Business recommendation on Yelp Dataset using GNN

:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it motivates us a lot!  

> We have a lot of customers, and we have a lot of research into our installed base. We also watch industry trends pretty carefully. But in the end, for something this complicated, it's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.  
> -- Steve Jobs <br>

## Overview

The Yelp Dataset comes as a series of JSON files, so we will start by downloading and preprocessing the dataset for training a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network.
Although GNNs are popular, a theoretical overview of how to use and create GNNs is needed to understand each step of the workshop.
Then, we will use Neo4j to inspect and visualize the graph.
The central part of the workshop focuses on how to use the DGL library to create a heterogenous Graph Neural Network, preprocess the dataset, and use the graph to produce business recommendations for users.
We will use Python, Deep Graph Library (DGL), and Neo4j.
The workshop can be followed using a Python Notebook and the Neo4j Desktop application.

## Masterclass at KGC
The Knowledge Graph Conference (KGC) 2023 is a 5-day hybrid conference with multiple parallel tracks every day, covering a multitude of topics related to knowledge graph technologies.  
This repo is for the masterclass yield by LARUS members at KGC.

## About us
LARUS R&D Tribe created this project.  
It would be hard for a tech company to remain innovative and competitive without a continuous investment in R&D. That is why in LARUS there is an entire tribe dedicated to research and technological development involved in an ongoing solid relationship with relevant Italian and foreign universities, observatories, research institutes, labs but also professors and researchers.

## Installation 
Assuming that you already have Python installed on your local machine.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
If you want to perform some graph exploration/visualization you also need to have Neo4j Desktop installed.  

# Thank you for your curiosity

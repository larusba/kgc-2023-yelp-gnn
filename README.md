# Business recommendation on Yelp Dataset using GNN

:star: Star us on GitHub â€” it motivates us a lot!  

> We have a lot of customers, and we have a lot of research into our installed base. We also watch industry trends pretty carefully. But in the end, for something this complicated, it's really hard to design products by focus groups. A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them.  
> -- Steve Jobs <br>

## Overview

The Yelp Dataset comes as a series of JSON files, so we will start by downloading and preprocessing the dataset for training a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network.
Although GNNs are popular, a theoretical overview of how to use and create GNNs is needed to understand each step of the workshop.
Then, we will use Neo4j to inspect and visualize the graph.
The central part of the workshop focuses on how to use the DGL library to create a heterogenous Graph Neural Network, preprocess the dataset, and use the graph to produce business recommendations for users.
We will use Python, Deep Graph Library (DGL), and Neo4j.
The workshop can be followed using a Python Notebook and the Neo4j Desktop application.
